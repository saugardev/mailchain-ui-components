Welcome to the documentation for [Mailchain UI Components](https://www.npmjs.com)! This is a versatile and modern npm package that uses [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/) to build a monorepo of two powerful libraries: `react-ui-components` and `angular-ui-components`. Our goal is to provide a seamless and consistent user interface (UI) experience across popular JavaScript frameworks such as [Angular](https://angular.io/), [React](https://reactjs.org/), and [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Features

- 🚀 Built with [Stencil](https://stenciljs.com/): A powerful toolchain for building reusable, scalable, and future-proof web components.
- 🔧 Monorepo structure: Manage `react-ui-components` and `angular-ui-components` within a single repository.
- ⚡️ Web Components: Create custom elements that work seamlessly across Angular, React, and Next.js applications.
